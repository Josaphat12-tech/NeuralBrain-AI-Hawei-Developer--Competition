# NeuralBrain-AI-Huawei-Developer-Competition

🌍 **AI-Driven Global Health Monitoring & Early Warning System**  
Built for the **Huawei Cloud Global Developer Competition**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**NeuralBrain AI** is a cloud-native, AI-powered platform designed to **predict, detect, and monitor public health risks before they escalate into outbreaks**.

By combining **open global health data, climate indicators, population metrics, and machine learning**, the system provides **early warnings and decision support tools** for governments, NGOs, and health organizations.

This project demonstrates how **Huawei Cloud + AI** can transform healthcare systems from **reactive response** to **proactive prevention**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
 
Current public health systems face major challenges:

- Late detection of disease outbreaks  
- Fragmented and siloed data sources  
- Limited predictive analytics in low-resource regions  
- Slow response to emerging health threats  

These limitations result in **avoidable loss of lives**, higher healthcare costs, and delayed interventions.

---

## 💡 Solution

NeuralBrain AI addresses these challenges by:

- Aggregating **global public health, climate, and population data**
- Applying **machine learning models for outbreak prediction**
- Detecting anomalies in disease trends automatically
- Generating **early warning alerts weeks in advance**
- Visualizing insights through interactive dashboards
- Running entirely on **Huawei Cloud infrastructure**

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- 📊 AI-based disease outbreak prediction (2–4 weeks ahead)
- 🔍 Anomaly detection for unusual health patterns
- 🌡 Climate & environmental factor correlation
- 🗺 Interactive risk heatmaps and trend analysis
